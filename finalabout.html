        Welcome! My name is Aleona Lund.<br> Ever since I was little, I discovered that my little hands had a huge desire to draw and create things of my own. I also loved to draw and cut my creations out(not very well I might add.) but I still enjoyed every minute of creativity I had. <br> I knew that my creativity would never stop nor did I want it to stop, it's a part of me and having the gift like that is what makes me the person I am today, I am a determined to share my creativity with the world and be successful as an artsit in the future.<br> Originally drawing was a hobby for me, then as I got older, I was encouraged by my amazing family and friends to try and sell my art. So, I started this website for 3 reasons: to blog about my art life, to get my art out, and to have people shop my line of work and have it be shared with the world.<br> Whenever I would post my work on the media people would always comment that I should be In an art show, or that they wanted to buy my work. Sometimes my family would tell me that the work I did sell couldve actually been sold for more, and thats what sparked my idea to sell my art and take classes on learning how to do so. I actually first took an HTML and The web class during college and discovered I enjoyed it. I knew I needed to get my out, and taking the HTML class was the perfect way for me to learn how to do so. <br>
        Whether youâ€™re a new follower or have been reading my blog from the beginning, thank you SO much for reading and supporting My Website Lona By Design. I will never be able to express how much it means to me. Love you all!

xo, Aleona
