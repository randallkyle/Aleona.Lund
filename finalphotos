for this lab i decided to keep my zebra watercolor image.<br>
 painting is a fun thing i enjoy doing a lot of the time, it also helps me relax and get things off my mind<br>
     there will be no other photos to display right now but maybe later <br>
   this will be the last text on this line<br>
    Actually Scientists aren't sure, but many theories center on their utility as some form of camouflage. The patterns may make it difficult for predators to identify a single animal from a running herd and distort distance at dawn and dusk. Or they may dissuade insects that recognize only large areas of single-colored fur or act as a kind of natural sunscreen. Because of their uniqueness, stripes may also help zebras recognize one another.
